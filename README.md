# Safe-Cracker
This project focuses on interpreting IA-32 (x86) assembly language using tools like the x86 disassembler (objdump) and the command line debugger (gdb) which challenges the ability to be able to work with assembly language and debugging but also my problem-solving and attention to detail skills.
I learned how to unlock binary files through objdump and gdb. I managed to successfully find clues through the gdb debugger allowing me to crack the inputs for all 4 safes.
